This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## To run the app:

Search for "todo: put your api key here:"
and replace the 'put_your_api_key_here' with your own key.
To get your own key, register on MovieDb (https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) and get an API key.
